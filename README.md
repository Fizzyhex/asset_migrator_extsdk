# Asset Migrator (For Unity modding)

Ever had files from one Unity project you wanted to migrate to another?

Usually you'd export a package, but this isn't ideal when exporting giant amounts of assets!

Or ever wanted to port a modding project from a prior game to a new one? Given the script's names remain the same, asset migrator should be able to port your favorite scenes / prefabs!

Asset migrator helps solve that problem by resolving meta files for you and copying data properly!
